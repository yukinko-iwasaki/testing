*   Reviewer verifies the package includes all components as per the checklist [here:](https://github.com/worldbank/wb-reproducible-research-repository/blob/main/reproducibility_package_checklist.md) 
  - [ ] Code files going from original data to the results in the paper (and ideally nothing else)
  - [ ] The data files required for analysis
  - [ ] The raw outputs
  - [ ] A readme file that explains how to run the package and explains data sources and any access restrictions. It's also okay if data details are provided in a separate data availability statement.
  - [ ] A link to the manuscript (if already published) or the manuscript itself
  - [ ] Make note of any missing components (even if they do not affect the running of the package). 
  - [ ] If the package has no readme and no information on the data, it gets returned to the author. If there is no main script, but the README is clear, we can work with that, but ideally, it would contain a main script.
